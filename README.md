# Effective-Business-Presentations

Once your visualizations are ready, you have to present it to others. Just like in any good story, a data story must have a good plot (theme and flow), good dialogue (talking points), and a great ending or big reveal (results and conclusions). This project is all about presenting the story using PowerPoint in a way that gets them engaged and motivated to act, including some design principles for effective visuals and slides and compelling storytelling.
